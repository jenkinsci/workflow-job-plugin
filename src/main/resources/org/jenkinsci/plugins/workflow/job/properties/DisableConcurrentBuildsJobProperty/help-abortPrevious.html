    By default, disabling concurrent builds means that new builds will queue up and wait for a running build to complete.
    With this option, scheduling a new build immediately aborts any running build.
    This is handy for example if you have an expensive pull request testing procedure
    and do not wish to waste any time completing tests on an outdated commit.
