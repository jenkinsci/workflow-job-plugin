## Changelog

### 2.40

Release date: 2020-09-03

- Fix: Prevent Pipeline builds from resuming after being aborted while starting (fix also requires Pipeline: Groovy plugin version 2.83 or newer) ([JENKINS-46961](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-46961))
- Fix: Make background of "Keep this build forever" button transparent to improve appearance when using [Dark Theme plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dark-theme/) ([PR 166](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/166))
- Internal: Fix flaky test (`WorkflowRunRestartTest.resumeDisabled`) ([PR 160](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/160))
- Internal: Update minimum required Jenkins version to 2.176.4, update parent POM, update dependencies, and update CI build configuration ([PR 163](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/163), [PR 165](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/165))

### 2.39

Release date: 2020-04-26

- Fix: The Pipeline console view did not work correctly in Internet Explorer 11 due to use of unsupported JavaScript functions. ([JENKINS-62025](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-62025))

### 2.38

Release date: 2020-03-26

- Fix: Refactor locking in `WorkflowRun` to prevent deadlock, which could cause Jenkins to hang forever in some cases. ([JENKINS-61604](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-61604))
- Fix: Remove "Custom" prefix on the console output page. This text was used for debugging and was not intended to be added to the plugin. ([PR 156](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/156))
- Internal: Use `Boolean.equals` when comparing `Boolean` objects instead of `==`. Previous usage of `==` appears to have been safe in practice, so this is only a refactoring. ([PR 154](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/154))

### 2.37

Release date: 2020-03-10

- Fix: Show branch names for parallel branches in truncated build logs when the parallel branch began before the current truncation point of the log. ([JENKINS-60862](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-60862))
- Fix: Remove polling baselines for Pipelines jobs immediately when an SCM is checked out in a build with polling and changelogs disabled. Previously, Jenkins needed to be restarted for the changes to polling to take effect. ([JENKINS-61415](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-61415))
- Internal: Add ignored test case for JENKINS-60724. ([JENKINS-60724](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-60724))
- Internal: Update parent POM and jenkins-test-harness dependency. ([PR 149](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/149)

### 2.36

Release date: 2019-11-04

- Fix: Call `FlowExecutionListener.onCompleted` on `FlowExecutionListener` extensions directly after calling `RunListener.onCompleted` on `RunListener` extensions (earlier than previously), so that `FlowExecutionLister.onCompleted` is called before the build log has been closed. ([PR 143](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/143))
- Developer: Add a new method `WorkflowRun.getSCMs` to obtain the list of SCMs used in a Pipeline build. ([PR 141](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/141))
- Internal: Migrate Wiki content to GitHub. ([PR 144](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/144))

    cases. Fixes some issues where `JenkinsRule.waitForMessage` worked
    inconsistently in tests.
-   Add internationalization support for the "Pipeline Steps" sidebar
    link in Pipeline builds. ([PR 128](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-job-plugin/pull/128))

-   [JEP-210](https://jenkins.io/jep/210): redesigned
    log storage system for Pipeline builds. **This update involves a new
    log file format.** Older releases will be able to display the
    whole-build log in a somewhat degraded fashion in the classic,
    though not Blue Ocean, UI. You are advised to also update [Pipeline Groovy Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-plugin) to 2.58.

### 2.18

Release date: 2018-04-08

> WARNING Build Format Not Back-Compatible  - trying to load WorkflowRuns with 2.17 or earlier will show a 'double onLoad error'

-   **Major bugfix / improvements**: numerous fixes & improvements to
    make Pipeline persistence & resume more robust (across all
    Durability Settings)  
    -   These do not have individual JIRAs because they were spinoffs
        from testing other work, discovered with fuzzing-like approaches
    -   Many of these bugs would result in irreproducible errors that
        may have been reported - **link any related JIRAs here**: (TBD)
    -   Improves error-handling logic
-   **Improvement**: Lazy-Load FlowExecution For Completed Pipelines -
    Avoids Loading FlowNodes If Not Needed
    ([JENKINS-45585](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-45585))  
    -   Improves performance **significantly** when plugins/operations
        load many Pipeline builds (weather column, etc) just to check
        the Result
    -   Makes an *especially* large difference for Performance-Optimized
        Pipelines with many steps
    -   This makes the 'completed' field persistent for Pipeline Runs
        and will trigger a one-time re-save for legacy builds
    -   **Back-compatibility** **Issue: the presence of the 'completed'
        field will introduce errors about double onLoad calls when
        downgrading to version 2.17.  This can be fixed (to allow for
        loading in earlier versions) by searching for all build.xml
        files containing the following strings and removing those
        lines:**
        -   `<completed>true</completed>`
        -   `<completed>false</completed>`
-   **Bugfix**: Fix one case where running Pipelines would not reflect an
    updated Resume Disabled status on the job
-   **Part of Bugfix**: Error "NullPointerException in
    SandboxContinuable.run0" after restart in Performance-Optimized
    Durability Setting
    ([JENKINS-50407](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50407))
    -   Remainder of bugfix is in Pipeline Groovy Plugin, version 2.47
-   **Part of Major Bugfix**: Error "NullPointerException in CPS VM
    thread at WorkflowRun$GraphL.onNewHead" as result of a race
    condition
    ([JENKINS-49686](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-49686))
    -   The other part of the bugfix is in the Pipeline Groovy Plugin -
        version 2.47
-   NullPointerException can be thrown due to null triggers list
    ([JENKINS-49170](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-49170)).
-   Bugfix / Improvement: Users can use Simple Theme Plugin to hide
    extra pipeline logging, because the 'pipeline-annotated' is now
    included
    ([JENKINS-41845](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41845))
-   **Part of Major Bugfix**: Failed pipelines resume and won't die even
    when marked to not resume, and show resume failures 
    ([JENKINS-50199](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50199))
    -   The other part of the bugfix is in the Pipeline Groovy Plugin -
        version 2.47
-   Update text: fix use of "slave" rather than "agent" for build
    computers - thank to Github user acrewdson for the contribution.

### 2.17

Release date: 2018-01-22

-   **Major Feature**: Support Durability Settings for a Pipeline
    ([JENKINS-47300](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-47300))  
    -   Allows user to greatly reduce IO needs of pipeline and improve
        performance
    -   This plugin consumes the setting and will reduce IO under the
        right settings
    -   Add property & UX for user to configure the Durability Setting
-   **Major Feature**: Add property and UI for user to mark a Pipeline
    as do-not-resume-at-restart
    ([JENKINS-33761](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33761))
-   Requires Jenkins 2.62

    fixes
    [JENKINS-28447](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28447).
-   Log file collection could block system threads under unreproducible

    defined in a multibranch `Jenkinsfile` via the `properties` step.
-   [JENKINS-34005](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34005)
    Converted triggers to a job property for the same reason. (Note that
    multibranch projects do not need an SCM trigger since branch
